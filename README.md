# Galfect

This is a quick tool converting a drama to html.
You can see a simple demo in [here][liriansu.com]

Project name come from '**gal**game ef**fect**'.

This is also a project for me to learn html&js.

# Installation

```
    pip install galfect
```

Then use `galfect templates/snow_white/white.drama`.

This would generate an individual repository named *white*.

You can open *white/index.html* in your browser to see the result.
